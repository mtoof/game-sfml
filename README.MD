### This my first project using SFML library written in C++.
I'm gonna work on it to make it better and better. At the moment I am working on the character's movement and shooting. I'm gonna add more features to the game in the future.
In the future I'm gonna write the whole game from scratch to make it better and more optimized. I'm gonna add some inheritance and polymorphism to the game to make it more object-oriented.

## Description:

It's a game character that can move in 2D space. The character can move in 4 directions: up, down, left, right, also can jump and shoot.

## How to run:
`cmake -B build`
`cmake --build build`
`./build/bin/main.exe` (Windows)
`./build/bin/main`(Linux or MacOS)

## How to play:
- Use the A,W,S,D keys to move the character.
- Use Space key to jump and use F key to shoot.
